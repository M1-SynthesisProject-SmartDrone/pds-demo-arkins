# Demo Arkins

This is a simple project aiming to show a little demonstration with all features implemented about arkins

## How to use it

First, launch the `install_dependencies.sh` script in order to install every needed dependencies.

Next, copy the `config/config.cfg.TEMPLATE` file, renaming it to `config/config.cfg` and put the configurations wanted for this computer (the `config/config.cfg` file is not pushed to the repository).

Finally, you can call the `compile.sh` file in order to compile the project, creating the executable in the `bin` folder (the config.cfg created must always be aside the executable in order to work).
